    "# 02807: Project 2\n",
    " \n",
    "## Practical information\n",
    " \n",
    "* This project must be completed in groups of 3 students.\n",
    "    * The group must be registered on the course site on DTU Learn: My Course > Groups\n",
    "    * Groups must be registered anew (even if you already registered for Project 1)\n",
    "* This project must be handed in as a jupyter notebook to the course site on DTU Learn. \n",
    "    * Go to the Course Content > Assignments tab to upload your submission. \n",
    "* This project is due on Monday, November 29, 20:00.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission rules\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each group has to hand in *one* notebook (`.ipynb`) with their solutions, including a filled out Contribution table (see below).\n",
    "* Your solution must be written in Python.\n",
    "* For each question you should use the cells provided (\"`# your code goes here`\" and \"*your explanation here*\") for your solution\n",
    "    * It is allowed to add code cells within a question block, but consider if it's really necessary.\n",
    "* You should not remove the problem statements, and you should not modify the structure of the notebook.\n",
    "* Your notebook should be runnable and readable from top to bottom.\n",
    "    * Meaning that your code cells work when run in order (from top to bottom).\n",
    "    * Output of any cell depends only on itself and cells above it.\n",
    "* Your notebook should be submitted after having been run from top to bottom.\n",
    "    * This means outputs are interpretable without necessarily running your cells.\n",
    "    * The simplest way to achieve this is using the jupyter menu item Kernel > Restart & Run All just prior to submission. If any cell fails when you do this, your notebook is not ready for submission.\n",
    "    * Exercise 3 in particular will take time to finish, plan accordingly, that is, make sure you have time to run your notebook from top to bottom.\n",
    "* Failure to comply may make it impossible for us to evaluate your submission properly, which will likely negatively impact the points awarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution guidelines\n",
    "* Data processing is via Spark for the first three exercises and pandas/SQL in the fourth exercise.\n",
    "* Where naming of dataframes and functions are explicitly stated, these must be used.\n",
    "* Your solutions will be evaluated by correctness, code quality and interpretability of the output. \n",
    "    * You have to write clean, readable and efficient Spark code that will generate sensible execution plans.\n",
    "    * You have to write clean, readable and efficient SQL queries.\n",
    "    * Your tables and visualisations should be meaningful and easy to read. This requires, but is not limited to, including headers, legends and well-written (brief) descriptions for graphs/charts. In this step you've found the data processing solution, so put also some effort into its presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Colaboration policy\n",
    " \n",
    "* It is not allowed to collaborate on the exercises with students outside your group, except for discussing the text of the exercise with teachers and fellow students enrolled on the course in the same semester. \n",
    "* It is not allowed to exchange, hand-over or in any other way communicate solutions or parts of solutions to the exercises. \n",
    "* It is not allowed to use solutions from similar courses, or solutions found elsewhere."

    "\n",
    "* The total amount of points in the project is 150.\n",
    "* You have to indicate who has solved each part of each exercise in a **contribution table**. \n",
    "* A group member can take credit for solving a part of an exercise only if they have contributed **substantially** to the solution. \n",
    "    * Simple contributions, such as correcting a small bug or double-checking the results of functions, are not sufficient for taking credit for a solution.\n",
    "    * Several group members can take credit for the same solution if they all have contributed substantially to it.\n",
    "* Each group member must contribute **at least 65 points**. \n",
    "    * If no name is provided for an exercise's part, **all group members** are considered contributors to it.\n",
    "* Group members should decide amongst themselves how to collaborate on the project to meet these constraints.  \n",
    "* Scores are individual. The score $\\text{score}(m)$ for a group member $m$ ranges from 0 to 10 and is calculated as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "  * $\\text{individual-score}(m) = \\frac{\\text{total number of points for the parts correctly solved by }m}{\\text{total number of points for the parts contributed by }m}$\n",

    "The goal here is to determine what sentiment (positive or negative) words in reviews have. Roughly speaking, we want each word to be assigned a score based on the rating of the reviews in which the word occurs in the review comment. We'd expect words such as \"clean\", \"comfortable\", \"superhost\" to receive high scores, while words such as \"unpleasant\", \"dirty\", \"disgusting\" would receive low scores.\n",

    "The score of a word is given by the mean review rating over the reviews in which that word occurs in the comment. We require words to appear in at least 0.5% (1 in 200) listings, and to be at least 4 characters, for it to have a defined score.\n",

To this end, we've made multiple samples of the dataset of varying sizes.\n",

Specifically, you must explain any non-linear relationship between data size and computation time, using the markdown cell at the end of this part. In finding explanations, using the Spark UI to investigate the anatomy of your queries may prove valuable. Once you've found an explanation, state a potential solution to remedy the issue. Lastly, include a paragraph stating the specifications of your computer hardware (memory, CPU cores and clock speed, solid state disk or not) on which the experiment has been run.\n",

If you think the latter is the case, argue for this perspective in the markdown cell.\n",

You requested the sales department of X to provide you with access to the customer and sales transactions database. To your horror, you've found no such database exists, but the data is instead manually maintained in a spreadsheet (error-prone solution). Intrepid as you are, you've accepted to receive the spreadsheet data as a `.csv`, realizing already data cleaning will be necessary.\n",

This entails using `psql.sqldf` to execute your queries (up against `df_transactions_cleaned`) which will return a pandas dataframe. Each question should be answered with a *single* query. For visualisation the `psql.sqldf` call should be followed only by functions necessary to customize the plotting/layout steps or reshape the dataframe (i.e. no data processing take place after your SQL statement is materialized as a pandas dataframe).\n",
